                THIS IS THE LAST PROYECT OF THE PISCINE (THE STUDENT'S SELECTION PERIOD)

This proyect draw the biggest square possible for the chosen map (bearing the obstacles represented with the third character at the map's header).


HOW TO USE:

- To compile just make "make".

- Then apply it to any map with "./bsq example_file".

- To make of modify any map be aware of the header's meaning and feel free to change it:

    At example_file, the header is 9.ox, representing: 9(number of rows) .(the empty character) o(the obstacle character) x(the drawn square content)
